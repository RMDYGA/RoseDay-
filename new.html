          <span>My Love,</span>
          <br />
          Roses are red, violets are blue, Nothing is sweeter, than loving<br /> you,.
The things you say make me smile.
I re - read all yours letter once in a while.
The things you write with all the rhymes,
They brighten my day thousand a times.
Valentine's day in years gone passed,
none of them, to date me they asked.
the dances at school, before I went home, 
I'd stand a side all alone.
Then you came along and said three words,
and of those three, I'm glad I heard.
So hear is a poem, from me to you,
It's simply to say, how much I love you!
